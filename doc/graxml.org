The GraXML viewer can view GeGeDe GDML

* Installation

See the [[http://hrivnac.web.cern.ch/hrivnac/Activities/Packages/GraXML/][GraXML home page]] for [[http://hrivnac.web.cern.ch/hrivnac/Activities/Packages/GraXML/JavaDoc/net/hep/graphics/GraXML/doc-files/Guide.html#Local%20Instalation][installation instructions]] but basically, download the tar file, unpack it and run

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./GraXML/bin/GraXML.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

To auto-load your GDML file (assumed to be =mygeo.gdml=) make a little file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE c++
  // mygeo.bsh
  // for some reason the default for this is 0.1
  net.hep.geant4.GDML.GeometricModel.Evaluator.setRescaleFactor(1.0);
  // load the actual GDML file.  The object "w" is premade
  w.show("mygeo.gdml");
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is a "Bean shell" script and mostly looks like C++.  You can then pass it in on the command line:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./GraXML/bin/GraXML.sh mygeo.bsh
#+END_EXAMPLE

More examples of what these script files can do are found at the GraXML pages.

After the app loads, click on your geometry in the tree viewer on the right-hand-side of the GUI.
