* ROOT's GDML importer and/or GDML itself

In no particular order:

 - order of volumes matter despite daughters being referenced by name (GraXML does not suffer this limitation)

 - single quoted strings are XML standard but (until recently) led to parse errors

 - although you can define a null position and rotation in the =define= section you must always supply both in a placement even if a null pos/rot is desired.
